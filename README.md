That's Nolan-G, Nolan-Language, or No-Language. Take your pick they all work! This is the start of something truly revolutionary: a very python-like language written in python (so that it's *extra* slow ofcourse) without the python bull***t. Dedicated to [nulzo](https://github.com/nulzo) bouncin on ma member. Which is obviously a reference to my trampoline of course which is something you bounce on over the weekend. 

Ethan - personally, I think python is one of the faster programming languages!

Anyways to run it for local development, I assume you have python installed already (Python 3.11 is required since this project uses [exception groups](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#exception-groups)). A simple `python nolang.py` will do, which should launch interactive mode. Otherwise you can specify a file to interpret as an additional arg: `python nolang.py <file>`.
